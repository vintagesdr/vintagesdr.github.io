Install Windows 7 from USB boot - Click "Install now" and choose "Custom / Advanced"
You should see "Where do you want to install Windows?" Click on "Drive options (advanced)"
Click on all the partitions (if any) one by one and delete them (You won't be able to click on and delete "Disk 0 Unallocated Space")
You should be left with  "Disk 0 Unallocated Space" and it should show the capacity of your hard drive. Click "Next"
Windows 7 should start to install. Wait, then follow the prompts to set a user name etc. and keep any recommended settings if asked.
When it's finished, click on the little Windows icon (bottom left) and type "disk management". Choose "Create and format hard disk partitions" from the search results.
Wait for the "Disk Management" window to load, 
In the lower half of the window, you should see 2 rectangles, each with a blue bar above it. Right-click on the one labled (C:), then left-click on ""Shrink Volume".
Keep the defaults, and click "Shrink". This will make space for us to install another Windows 7 alongside the one we've already installed (the reason will become clear later).
When it's finished, you should see a new partition showing "Unallocated" space.
Close the "Disk Management" window, insert the Windows 7 bootable USB stick you used before, and reboot the computer with the USB stick.
